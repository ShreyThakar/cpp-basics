This folder contains **very basic C++ programs**. These programs are meant for **absolute beginners** who are just starting to learn C++.

Each program focuses on **one simple concept only**, so it is easy to understand and practice.

## 📂 Note on File Order (GitHub Behavior)

While working on this repository, I learned that **GitHub displays files in alphabetical order by default**, not in the order in which they are uploaded.

Because of this, the sequence shown in the folder may not reflect the recommended learning order. To make the learning path clear and beginner-friendly, the correct sequence is documented in this README.

This understanding helped me organize my repository in a more professional and readable way.
